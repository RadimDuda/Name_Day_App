Nameday App

This application offers various APIs that allow working with a nameday database. The functionalities include uploading a list of namedays (dates and names) from a .txt file into the database, displaying all the namedays, selecting namedays by name or a part of the name (wildcard "\*" for searching is available), selecting names by a given date, and adding a new nameday into the database.

For the proper functionality of all APIs, it is necessary to upload the namedays into the database from the file "svatky.txt". You can find the file at this link: https://github.com/RadimDuda/Name_Day_App/tree/main/SampleData.
